A simple single-player game using HTML5 Canvas.

To run, download the entire package and open the .html file in a browser.

This is pretty much a copy of the original A-door-able found here http://ncase.me/door/

Warning: only tested on Chrome and the canvas is hard-coded to a size of about 800*1700. This was meant as an exercise for me, so it is likely far from perfect.
